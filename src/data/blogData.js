I thought it would provide the translations to me already but it does not. It's more a system of setting up the files so that you can then provide language support of converted documents. Basically, I would have to run this thing through a translator to provide this and save the JSON file. Gotta be an easier way though.",
      "So here is what I'm thinking. I found this API called yandex for translating. I'm trying to keep this cheap, and they seem to be pretty robust and offer a range of services from this. Gonna look more into this. But for right now I should probably reign it in. I've made a dynamic dropdown and began setting up for that kind of support but don't have the energy to run this thing through an API. Gonna start with the code I have for 1:18 though. If I wanted to do it without an API I could probably run this through google translate. But still, awful lot of work wehn I could just do it automated in the start. A little bit of upfront for a lot less work later on. Plus if I do end up trying to sling some shopify sites on the side, this will make qualifying for translation a ton easier.",

      "Got SCSS set up, took it off of mapping everything so that it doesn't take up as much space. I don't use those maps anyway. I'm wondering if my file architecture is right here. Some people put them all in a stylesheet and I thought that I wasn't a fan of that becuase it made it hard to find your file in styles and at the component level. Tomorrow first order of business should probably be to toggle that setting and change where they all route to and make it route to its own style sheet. It doesn't really matter where it goes, after all, as long as it all pulls in the data. My main reasoning for this is that it is difficult to have components like Navbar.js right between Navbar.css and Navbar.scss. I keep clicking the wrong one and if I keep doing that something is going to get overridden and made more difficult in the future.",

Truthfully, I'd like a fresh start now that I've had some time to think about architecture. My blog template right now requires a place for tags. And I will have to edit this whole thing. I don't want to scrub away all of the truth of my experience here though. I have the luxury of knowing that devs are made through trial and error and failure. That doing things wrong is sometimes more valuable than doing things right. If you've had to fix it - you've found out intimately how it's broken. That the best part of this job is getting done with doing something really hard and getting to be proud of it and later avoiding that mistake.",

I'm thinking about saving json files to a separate repo for backup as part of the build process as I go. Will do that once I get that set up. For right now, I'm backing up here. I remember versioning being very tricky and having scrap and wipe becuase I was so novice at versioning. I would like to avoid that this time around, but I'm a pragmatist.

I set up the boilerplate yesterday - stuff like a message saying what it would do, just like they taught in bootcamp and then today made the mongoose models, set up the db locally, and got it to connect through routing. It does the CRUD stuff and actually had minimal problems in setting up. Typo here and there but overall was very easy for me to go in and fix when the time came. Definitely felt easier than any times before. When I was just learning, it took me an entire week to do what I was able to do in a few hours. Even less time because I spent an hour on the Legion of Code standup meeting (a little something I cooked up to keep myself and my coding/graphic design/ux buddies working on stuff and having deadlines.) Also spent another hour with Molly talking about her design goals specifically and getting a little insight into photoshop. Crazy how quickly she can make really cool looking art.

I'm lucky that I know what to do in this situation since I just went through this two months ago, but it is a little frustrating in that I only just put some of that stuff back a week or two ago only to have to move it all across the floor at once. Still, CJ can help this time since his back is back to normal, so this has made the process immensely easier. I have to admit, my first reaction was to panic but I feel alarmingly in control.",

Luckily, while I was dealing with all of the flooding nightmare I was able to think through my problem by the time I got the computer set up and get all my endpoints postman tested, which was nice. I know in its current format I don't like how the logout is set up but I also know that I still have another day of work to get this part to a good place and then I have to set up the interface on the other end as well.

It's been kind of our lab/workshop for art things, and I've spent some time fixing it up not too long ago, so it makes a fair sanctuary from the flood nightmare in which I can work.

Also, enthusiasm as a bill collector usually ended up souring the rest of your life in some way. I stayed there for so long because I wanted to be near the data or writing in a spreadsheet.

I believe I hinted that i would probably have a clearer picture after getting a few days to spin up the problem. That's how I am. A quick answer often gets revised. I used to be editor in chief of my high school paper. That baby had a lot of drafts. It's one of my strengths, but my weakness is speaking too soon and too declaritively.",
      "So to rectify this I wanted to double check that I spoke correctly there and actually go through the problem from a new angle.",
      "Here's the thing I'm thinking - I'm a layman. I'm not the DM. Normally I would think of this as a detriment, but I am reminded of that 99% invisible podcast where they talk about curb cuts. https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/transcript. They talk about how curb cuts end up being good for everyone, not just people in wheelchairs. It's great for the people in wheelchairs, and also people with strollers, people on bikes. I know a guy who uses the final fantasy hearing assistance add on becuase it helps him know when he has been hit more easily. Accessibility is a great thing to have, especially when paired with the option to have it your way. I think it's that way for people who lazily skim character sheets, like me. I'm motivated to make it easier, because I have a short attention span and knows what keeps my attention and what doesn't.",
      "Also a weird underdog selling point - I don't want to repeat myself. I live in the forest but I want my code to be like the torrid AZ desert I grew up in - DRY. Bill Gates said 'I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Becasue a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.' DRY is the lazy man's best friend. It means you can iterate quickly if you can identify parts of these games that are like parts of other games. It gives you a jumping off point for standardization.",
      "So essentially - the question isn't how you would design an individual character sheet so much as how you would assemble the component parts of ANY character sheet or ALL character sheets.",
      "Luckily, they have a UI/UX designer of repute, so that makes things incredibly easier. I kind of like constraints. What I imagine would be the approach here would be to start mobile first on the redesign but offer legacy options as well for those who don't want to make the switch immediately or are quite all right with the current design. With modern libraries (React and contemporaries), not hard to provide both options.",
      "I was asked how I would go through a game if I were to build the character design for a tabletop game - any tabletop game. This is a brilliant approach because realistically I know they need scale to do what they are doing. They now have a lot of intellectual properties that are going to need support and going to need to be able to get to MVP quickly and fast. This platform is already well regarded in their sphere and are doing a lot right. But in the tech age, they need agile mobile first design and encapsulation. At least, this is how I'm understanding the problem.",
      "So I picked up Monster of the Week and started looking through the sheet to see some things it shared and differed from other games of its type.",
      "So what are some examples of reusable design?",
      "D&D and Cyberpunk RED for instance both have skills that are rolled that can affect other skills as modifiers. So they have a standalone stat and a modifier stat that gets added to skills.",
      "I was taking a look at Monster of the Week today and saw that their moves are similar to D&D in that they are invoked upon command and then have dice rolls that work on modifiers. We consolidate by making a spells/moves class. The Gear or weapons also should be their own reusable stat - all three of those games share that.",
      "If there were to be another FATE-like or Fiasco type game, the onboarding of Monster of the Week would also fit the bill for this, for instance since it involves people going around the table and filling in their relationships with others.",
      "The luck, harm, and experience counters remind me a bit of cthulian horror games in their similarity to a 'sanity' check and I imagine this is somewhat what the designers intended on this. (Haven't hardcore done my research - but this is from skimming the first player section from an hour so cut me some slack.)",
      "Some things, like choosing your alignment in D&D or choosing your archetype in Monster Hunter or even Cyberpunk RED are done just once. That's onboarding.",
      "As a lazy layman who has a short attention span, this made me consider that if it has not already been a consideration, it may be wise for the team when thinking of sweeping design changes to think to opportunities to simplify ease of use for onboarding characters. The best apps I have used for character creation have tried to keep things simple.",
      "The one that stands out to me as a shining example is the Cyberpunk RED companion. I have used that pretty much since it came out and though it had a few glitches to start (typing was one) the app had a very nice way of walking you through the problem of getting set up in Cyberpunk. It may not have every expansion, but it did a great job of giving you a convenient way to see your character, add and remove items, showing stats, and rolling for you on command and adding modifiers.",
      "There are things that a computer is better at than a human. Adding numbers is one, calculating rolls is another. Opportunities here for people to pick whether they see this roll or not or see the modifiers or not. Some people don't want to see them and want to see this on the back end, some people want to see them all of the time, and some people want to see tehm when they want to see them but otherwise hide them. So you want to write some equations that take this into account, classify them and document well what these things do in a centralized location so that as you are designing a character sheet for a new game you have a bit of a library to choose from of similar options and then plug in the options. Much the same way SCSS works, or even the React library iteself. It's all that OOP/class architechture stuff at its core.",
      "Anyway, now that I've written out all of these thoughts I'm utterly exhausted. I'll rework this probably as I go throughout the next few days, but I wanted to get out a few key things that stood out to me as I have been mulling over the problem so far. I definitely know that it is going back into the oak barrell for a few days before I'm ready to break it down succinctly though.",

There's no reason to make any of that mess any harder for anyone. Any dev worth their salt knows that there are often more times when they don't at all feel qualified than when they do.

It did not work for my friend on firefox but I think that's a red herring because it also didn't work for CJ when I had shown it to him on my five by friday challenge on his phone. So I am beginning to think that perhaps it is due to a privacy setting. I'm also beginning to think that troubleshooting it is more trouble than it is worth as it is kind of a silly API in general. I mostly chose it because it was easy and I was very short on time and wasn't getting a whole lot of sleep that week. So I'm going to unlist it from the main page. If anyone wants to see it they should be able to type in /ip here - but I really don't know why it isn't working. I have a hunch it may have to do with VPNs.",
      "5.) EXCEPT.... I have another more pressing bug that CJ discovered this morning. I actually can't get to any of my pages by typing / anything right now. So this is a problem. This I think is my main concern right now. Hopefully an easy fix. Time to go to the docs for react-router-dom 6. Annoying the first result is for 5 and you have to look it up again. Gonna build and see if my hotfix takes.",

I also need to tweak the layout and maybe break out the detailed view into another window.

      "Seriously, after the last week of back and forth trhashing with github/cpanel etc I think this is what I'm going to go back to - vellum, paper, anything but computers. I think I may now have a good deployment strategy but I am thinking that github pages takes a little bit to load in. I inadvertantly fixed my SSL issue, which is nice though. Definitely a win. Maybe next week is actually a reasonable deadline for the node part of this after all. If I have the ssl, that's a lot of the heavy lifting out of the way. Routing issue seems that it may be related to how html5 routes things, there are a few different workarounds for this. Was hoping that the github pages and redirect would be a good route to go. Cpanel has some sort of interface for this as well as github pages. Not sure if they are the same thing or parts of them are unrelated. Will be elated when the build is no longer a concern. I love programming but I can't say I am as excited about deployment. I did get to learn some novel git commands for when things get fubar though today.",

      "I am back in the code dojo, though, which is nice. I was in the crafts room last week which felt like it was forcing me to be always coding when I would normally get some time offline for crafts. Living room is still a nightmare though. Poor CJ, all he wants to do is play Elden Ring and lay down because of his back and he has to do it cramped between all of the furniture that has been shoved to that side of the room due to the flood. We've been calling the property managers to find out if they can send someone out to shampoo - it's been like this for more than a week and it smells like musty gym sneakers in here. Feel like we've been losing our minds a little becuase no one can relax in here. My solution has been to throw myself into code but all work and no play makes Roz overstimulated and overwhelmed. For all my talk of going to go play FFXIV I normally end up stuck on a bug all night just wanting to make 'one more change' and suddenly it is 3:00 AM here. It'd be nice if I was able to have a true work schedule - but being unemployed - all I can think is that I need to be doing as much as I can so I don't stay unemployed.",
      "In spite of the long employment gap here due to the career change, I have never been unemployed nearly this long. Before CJ, I was the breadwinner. I vowed not to let what happened to my father happen to me. My father, brilliant in some areas, wasn't employed much after I turned about 7-ish. I saw the cycle of unemployment turn into depression and it just gets worse from there. He was very hard on himself. I remember finding his journals when I was around that age and they were quite dark. I think it gets really difficult when you tie your worth to what you do. I'm trying very hard to do all I can to get back into working but I have to remember that just as important is not letting this get to me because that will become a self fulfilling prophecy.",
      "Still, I'd be lying if I said it didn't get to me at all. I try to tell myself that we are different people and I have different skills than he has. I have friends and people who want to be around me. I am kind to myself. I have a support system. I have backup skills. And I know that I can do this. Sure, I have imposter syndrome - but I also know a lot of devs and know that everyone goes through this point right here where things are terrifying and you're just trying to take up as little space as possible because you can't afford to do anything else and you feel bad about the resources it takes to keep you housed and healthy in the mean time. I'm so terribly lucky to be able to have the opportunity to do this without having to live in my car. But the guilt is immeasurable. I cannot wait to repay this kindness in full and it tugs on me at all times.",

I don't often allow myself the time to process some of the fear associated with being out of work becuase I don't find it constructive. But I do feel better now after having a good cry. I think this is a good sign it is time to pack in for today though. Can fix the rest of this mess soon enough.",

I've heard that it is somewhat impressive to have a build with 0 vulnerability warnings, and by god, I wanted that gold star.",
      "So I've been going through some of the common ones to make sure that everything is cleaned up. The problem is that the build of React that comes from create-react-app comes with not only a lot of bloat, but a lot of holes in security - dependencies that have nested dependencies that cause problems. Nth-check has been the bane of my existence on this, as well as a package called svgo or svgr used for svg transformations. Thing is, some of the dependencies causing that audit warning have long since been fixed.",
      "So I went through and set up npm shrinkwrap to take care of stuff like this on this part of the site, but also the backend that I am getting set up. Shrinkwrap is amazing. It's like your package lock file, only you are able to edit dependencies there and have NPM respect your decisions. Implementation is dead easy, too. You type npm shrinkwrap, then it changes your package-lock file to package-shrinkwrap. Operates exactly the same, except that you can edit it right there. Go into your node modules and delete the offending module, then search your package-shrinkwrap file to see where the offending package is and note the version numbers for the fixed packages. This does take some googling, because you will need to search for vulnerabilities and fixes for whatever package this is. You have to be a bit creative and drill down to see what is causing the problem. Anyway, once you have that done, you test it and the program still works, type git rm package-lock.json (otherwise you will get errors when you try to build - this happened on heroku yesterday) and then make your commits like normal.",

Wish I could ask him, but he's been awol from our group chat for a while now, as is Tonny, so I'm a bit on my own. In bootcamp, those guys were a cut above and worked so dilligently.

      "There was this thing I didn't quite understand about SSL certs, even though I have used them enough and somehow blindly stumbled into getting them set up front and back. I messed up so bad I accidentally learned about powershell. That probably should have been a red flag that I was going in the wrong direction, but at that point I was ready for any hail mary I could find.",
      "On the bright side, dear reader, you can benefit from my experience. CJ put it to me this way: 'You wouldn't expect the DMV to give you a driver's license for me'. So I had to install two new certs for my dev environment today - one for each dev environment in localhost. Ran into a bit of trickiness in figuring out how to mention them to webpack - but it turns out that setting them in the environment variables in dev is the way to go rather than putting them in the scripts. At least, I couldn't get them to work on the scripts. Plus, it's not like prod doesn't already have them. I did manage to find a better SSL cert maker - mkcert. Worked like a charm for my dev encvironments. Download through chocolately worked for me and then make them in powershell with admin access.",
      "So after an embarrassing amount of time I figured that out only to still be hit with a CORS error and going down the list of requirements. I swear it wasn't like this just a little while ago, chrome/google have been making a lot of changes to make things more secure. This is good, but also annoying. Why not both?",
      "So I want to update my site very soon with these changes, but I am extremely tired and have been feeling the fatigue, so I think this must be a tomorrow thing. Tomorrow is a big day because I have to meet with my potential clients and work on drawing up a contract.",
      "Truthfully, I probably won't get a lot of coding done from this until later tomorrow. It will be a lot of researching minushia regarding legalities etc. I need to look over the contract I came up with the other day and make sure that I'm not missing any contingencies. When CJ said that he 'hates all the parts of programming that aren't programming' I didn't think part of that would end up being contract law, but here we are. Guess I'm finally putting that business degree to use.",
      "So anyway, my choom. Maybe one more day before I make a little change and update the server with the blog info from all of these. Just don't feel like troubleshooting anything more tonight.",
      "Also, for those of you wondering where we are in Buffy, we just got to the part where Faith was introduced. Faith reminds me a lot of younger me, back when I was a reckless adrenlaine fiend. Younger me had quite the penchant for urban exploring. Though realistically, I have always seemed like Faith on the outside and felt like Willow on the inside.",

      "Spent most of my day looking over contract stipulations and doing other business minusha like job applications and message responses. Looks like no business license is required to operate out of Oregon, and in Washington, if I make under 12k, no business license is required. One less barrier to entry, I guess. So for now, things are kind of easy on that side of things. Still, if they get better, I'll need to look into finally forming an LLC. Turns out this is pretty cheap in Washington, $200 for an LLC and this includes the $18 business license. Good to see that associates degree wasn't entirely wasted.",
      "Even so, contract reading is far from my favorite part of the job. Looking forward to being able to code more now that I've hashed out the details of the job with my clients. Should be exciting to get paid for what I do officially and get some valuable experience. That, my chooms, has been the hardest hurdle to cross so far - getting paid for what I know. I guess it's not like I don't know why. I've seen some terrible code in the wild and some really lazy hacks. Heck, I used to do them when I was a younger dev. Heck, such a huge part of development is realizing that the code you wrote yesterday was garbage and knowing how to do it better the next.",
      "Speaking of, here is a lecture I've been watching that soundsd a lot like the rants I make to CJ about npm packages and variable names: https://youtu.be/FyCYva9DhsI. Kind of glad to get some backup on this.",
      "So what time I had left I've spent trying to work out the redux, but I think I've changed the model of how the server responds a few too many times and need a break. Did some minor editing in pug to make things look a little prettier. Hopefully I get a chance to get this thing updated rather soon, I'm getting antsy about putting out something new here and being able to get the rest of the functionality built out. Unfortunately, the ability to sign in and sign up is kind of crucial and I'm somehow not fitting this round block through the round hole and instead created a star shaped peg somewhere along the way. So it is time for me to be done for today. Legalese melts the brain, my friends.",

      "Been working on getting the signup running for a while now, keep running into stupid problems. It should be so easy, right? Except I want to avoid using MUI components etc in favor of a DIY approach. Validation has been frustrating, some of the regex gets too complex and modern password managers don't always account for special characters. Been a right headache. And I think I've been at it too long, because I somehow broke things that were working earlier trying to streamline. Frustrating.",
      "I think I know what is happening right now that is preventing it. I think that when you put in the wrong qualifiers for password and email it loses all of the previous info when you go to change things over. So I keep getting this error for missing username even though it is in the box. Thing is, I think React has forgotten the username because the dom refreshed on that area or reset the state of the username. This is made all the more frustrating since it is down all of these layers of redux that I've added in. I think I need to look at the lifecycle of this component, but I know I don't have the brainpower to troubleshoot any more today. So frustrating because on the package, this all seems like such an easy thing to do. There aren't even that many fields, how can three little boxes be so needlessly complex. Ugh. I'm sure the answer is dead simple but I don't have the bandwith to do any more today. Did learn some neat things about pattern validation and autocomplete though. Nice of google to have the autocomplete stuff. Just wish I could feed them my regex. Also, the pattern matching seems to glitch in react due to its life cycle as well.",
      "Also, want to add in a way for people to see if their username is taken before the error goes through. Thinking I need to rework my responses as well to the validation. I bet I went about this all wrong and can just do it from Mongo instead, within the schema itself. This is so silly but I'm frustrated because it took so much work to get it functioning in the first place through redux.",
      "Looks like tomorrow it is back to react basics for me to figure this out. Hoping that I get that contract back though, would be a welcome distraction. So I guess for now I'm stuck writing in JSON for another day at least.",
